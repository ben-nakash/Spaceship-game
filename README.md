# Space Wars Game

This game was created by Ben Nakash & Elad Mizrahi as part of Games Development course we had during our Software Engineering studies.

It is based on the classic "Space Invaders" game, where a player plays as a spaceship, countering alien enemies. </br>
The objective is simple - kill your enemies while dodging their bullets. </br>
Throughout the game you will encounter in round artifacts coming down from blown up enemies ships - this is a weapon upgrade. Collect them to enhance your fire power.

To play the game download the repository and run the SpaceshipGame.exe file </br>
Hope you'll enjoy our game!</br>
Good luck! :)
